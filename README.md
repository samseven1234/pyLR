In this tool, you just have to input the values of x and y, space separated and hit enter, then automatically, infos will appear such as means, dataframe, summations, r value, and more!
But first, you have to install some packages for this tool to work.

Commands :
```
apt install python3
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
```

After installing packages, now we're ready to clone and use this by :
```
git clone https://github.com/samseven1234/pyLR.git
cd pyLR
python3 pyLR.py
```
And the tool should work.
